# Project_Silk_AgTech_Park

<p>We like to present our project as a Smart NFT System(Smart Green House System). Here we are going to fully automate the NFT Tunnel. 
And also, we are going to give a prediction about the harvest of the plants.</p>

<p><b><u>IoT Technology<u></b> based NFT environment monitoring and controlling system is using sensors to detect the parameters in the tunnel such as temperature, humidity, light, pH values. 
Mainly we are going to control the water supply, nutritious and fertilizer supplies to the plants due to the NFT is a fully hydroponic system.</p> 

<p>Farm holders and authorized staff can monitor all the parameters and crop growth by the real time <b><u>mobile application</u></b>. 
Not only that but also, they get alerted when harm happens to crops by checking if the water level, pH levels, EC levels and the fertilizing amount are enough, high, or low.</p>

<p>By analysing past records, farm holders can get a <b><u>prediction report</u></b>. 
By using this, they can get an idea about the future harvest which is our main target of this project.</p>
